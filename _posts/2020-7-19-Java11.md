title: Java 11 new Files methods
---

Java 11 introduced readString and writeString to the Files class. These methods are used to write and read strings directly to and from files:
```Java
readString​(Path path, Charset cs)
writeString​(Path path, CharSequence csq, Charset cs, OpenOption... options)
```

I have combined an example for read/writeString with another example for creating files- this enables the writeString example to function without the need for you to create the file manually.

 ```Java
import java.io.File;
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.nio.file.Paths;
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.StandardOpenOption;
 
public class FileWriteMethodExample 
{
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
        Path filePath = Paths.get("C:/", "Users/User", "test.txt");
 
        try
        {
            Files.writeString(filePath, "Hello World1 !!\n", StandardOpenOption.APPEND);
            String content = Files.readString(filePath);
            System.out.println(content);
        } 
        catch (IOException e) 
        {
			System.out.println("No such file.");
			try {
				File myObj = new File("C:/Users/User/test.txt");
				if (myObj.createNewFile()) {
					System.out.println("File created: " + myObj.getName());
					
                    Files.writeString(filePath, "Hello World2 !!\n", StandardOpenOption.APPEND);
                    String content = Files.readString(filePath);
                    System.out.println(content);
			    }
			} catch (IOException e2) {
				System.out.println("An error occurred.");
				e.printStackTrace();
				e2.printStackTrace();				
			}
        }
    }
}
```

[W3Schools: Create file with try-catch](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_files_create.asp)

After four runs, this will be the program output:

Program output:
```Console
C:\Users\User\code\practiceProblemScratchPad\java>"C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-14.0.2\bin\Java" FileWriteMethodExample
Hello World2 !!
Hello World1 !!
Hello World1 !!
Hello World1 !!
```

HelloWorld2 is printed when the file is created and each subsequent HelloWorld1 indicates an APPEND to the file.

Ah! What a transition to speak of the optional function arguments. To read you only must specify a filepath, with the option to specify a character set. However to write is a bit more involved.
```Java
writeString​(Path path, CharSequence csq, Charset cs, OpenOption... options)
```

To write, you provide the path and string to be written at the path. As before, you have the option to provide a character set. What I want to draw attention to is OpenOption.
In our example, we chose to use StandardOpenOption.APPEND so naturally I ask what our other options may be?

Simply click on the argument in question from within the [Oracle documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/file/Files.html) to get here:
[Standard Open Option Enum](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/file/StandardOpenOption.html)

I've borrowed directly from this page the following table:


APPEND | --- | If the file is opened for WRITE access then bytes will be written to the end of the file rather than the beginning.
CREATE | --- | a new file if it does not exist.
CREATE_NEW | --- | Create a new file, failing if the file already exists.
DELETE_ON_CLOSE | --- | Delete on close.
DSYNC | --- | Requires that every update to the file's content be written synchronously to the underlying storage device.
READ | --- | Open for read access.
SPARSE | --- | Sparse file.
SYNC | --- | Requires that every update to the file's content or metadata be written synchronously to the underlying storage device.
TRUNCATE_EXISTING | --- | If the file already exists and it is opened for WRITE access, then its length is truncated to 0.
WRITE | --- | Open for write access.


I encourage you to play with the Options!

As we did last time, let's end with what is in my opinion the simplest of the three Files additions- the method isSameFile(Path path, Path path2);
This static method returns a boolean, as you might expect. It's useful to determine if two paths represent the same file.
	
Thanks for looking! My next post will cover the difference between Java.io and Java.nio and I will be beginning my research here: https://www.baeldung.com/java-io-vs-nio
