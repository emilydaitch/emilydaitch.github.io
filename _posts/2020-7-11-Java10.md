title: Java 11 What's has been added... and how can I use it in my software?
---

What's new? Not Java 11. Java 11 was released the 25th of September 2018. 
However, it is the latest LTS (Long Term Support) release by oracle.
Read more to sewhat was added.

Although Java 14 is out, the scope of this post is just what was added from specifically in Java 11. This is particularly relevant to projects
that may be stilll be updating from the older LTS Java 8. Additional reccomended reading (and possible future postings) would include Java 9 and
Java 10 updates.

I will start off with my personal favorite addition, for it's potential use in leetCode style coding challanges involving string manipulation.
Java 11 introduces new string methods: repeat(int), lines(), strip(), stripLeading(), stripTailing(), and isBlank()

Let's start with an example from [howtodoinjava](https://howtodoinjava.com/java11/repeat-string-n-times/) . It shows how we can create a string that is composed of repeats of some substring.

```Java
String repeat () example
public class StringRepeat 
{
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
        String str = "Abc";
 
        System.out.println( str.repeat(3) );
    }
}
```
Example 1: Java 11 String class creates a repeated string

Program output-

Console
AbcAbcAbc

From this, let's construct our own examples referencing [the documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/allclasses.html) and Example 1.
Java String lines() does not return number of lines as you might expect, but returns a Stream of Strings

```Java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.stream.Stream;

public class StringLines {

    public static void main(String args[]){
        String str = "Abc\nAbc\nAbc\n"; 
 
        Stream<String> lines = str.lines();
        lines.forEach(System.out::println);
    }
}
```
Example 2: Java 11 String class prints all lines of a string

Referncing another lines() [example](https://howtodoinjava.com/java11/string-to-stream-of-lines/) example, let's explore strip() and it's derivatives with simple error handling, for good measure.

import java.io.IOException;
 
 ```Java
public class StringStrip {

    public static void main(String args[]){
        
        try
        {
	    String str = "    leading - tailing     ";
            System.out.println(str);            
            System.out.print("String:\n");
            System.out.print("strip:\n");
            System.out.print(str.strip());
            System.out.print("stripTailing:\n");
            System.out.print(str.stripTrailing());
            System.out.print("stripLeading:\n");
            System.out.print(str.stripLeading());
        } 
        catch (Exception e) 
        {
            e.printStackTrace(); // NetBeans hint: throwable printStackTrace should be removed...
        }
    }
}
```

Now let's wrap up with what might be the simplest one: isBlank(). Unlike isEmpty(), isBlank() does not check stringLength. 

 ```Java
	Let String str = " A non-whitespace character or two  "
	str.isEmpty() - FALSE
	str.isBlank() - FALSE
	
	str.isEmpty() - FALSE
	str.isBlank() - TRUE
	
	Let String str = ""
	str.isEmpty() - TRUE
	str.isBlank() - TRUE
```
	
Hope this was interesting, next post will cover reading / writing Strings to and from files.
