I am using Jekyll to create this blog from [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
I am currently writing blog posts about Java. I took one Java course in college, but have rarely come into contact with it since.
I think that writing technical posts about languages I am unfamiliar with will help me to get comfortable being uncomfortable!
